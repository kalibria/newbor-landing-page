## Novaya Borovaya fantasy landing page

I decided to practice HTML, CSS and Javascript by mocking a Novaya Borovaya landing page. There is a limited offer for apartments in a particular house, and the timer is ticking. 

Without focusing much on design I paid closer attention to BEM practices in HTML/CSS as well as to trying Javascript core.

My task was to master the following techniques:

- responsive website using media queries
- create and style navbar
- work with images and effects that can be applied to them
- program timer logic, with a message appearing after the timer expires
- create a loan calculator that would output the max possible load you are qualified for, or display a message saying a user is not qualified
- add a form to contact the bank, with various types of inputs (checkbox, select, numeric input, etc.)
- add dynamic year to the footer
- add links to LinkedIn personal profile and Github

What could be improved:

- functions could be split into ES modules (will practice that in my next pet project)
- overall design could be improved to match the standards of the 2020s, but that was not my primary focus
